 mod screen{}:
 
    I will have to change the game size and other variables to replicate pacman


mod raw_images{}:

    I will have to create my own images pixel art. 
    I will have to change the loaded pictures to mine 

mod images{}:

    This will remain sameish but will have to modify the variable names 
    to reflect pacman and might have to add additonal variable for new assets

    I will also only have one level of pacman that always looks the same 

mod world {}:

    I will likely change very little in here
    I will have to change the two constants after that load resources

mod inits {}:
    
    Will have to adjust speeds to reflect pacman 

impl Amidar {}: 

    Will have to change type to pacmand and reimplement the colors 
    

impl Default for Amidar{}:

    Will have to assess all variables implemented here
    Maybe add stuff like score, bonus, speed 

impl ScreenPoint {}:

impl TilePoint {}:

impl WorldPoint {}: 

    These 3 are unlikely to change much assuming a continue with a tile system
 
impl Tile {}:

    Likely won't change that much 

imple MovementAI {}:

    Will likely leverage this to make AI move, remove chase AI 



Pacman State: Will be derived from intrinsics of the PacMan type:

lives, score, level, player, enemies, board, board will contain pellets 

each tile may have a pellet or power pellet 

So I will start reading through types.rs

steal this rust implementation 

steal rust implementation and integrate with toybox 


Variables I'll need for Pacman struct

Player moves an entire tile at a time

enemy lookup ai, which im not using, is default planned routes that don't care about board
